**Big Project - goldguess.s**

Oh No! No-Face has eaten too much and has morphed into its terrifying monstrous form!
He has presented to you (Sen) a handful of gold nuggets and has challenged you to guess the value it holds.

Sen has 3 chances to guess it right. Guess correct and the gold nuggets shall be Sen's. Guess wrong and Sen will be gobbled up.

You (No-Face) will be tasked by No-Face to write a program in his beloved language MIPS to determine if Sen is awarded the gold or becomes dinner. At every guess, tell Sen if her guess is either too low/ high.

If she guesses it within 3 tries, congrats she wins! If she runs out of tries, you know what's coming...
